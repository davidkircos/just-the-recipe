## Why?
We created Just-The-Recipe.com because we were tired of recipe websites that tell you their whole life story, and we were looking for a place to put all of our favorite family recipes. 

## Who?
Caroline and David built this website together. They live in Boulder, CO with their two dachshunds Sadie and Sophie.
